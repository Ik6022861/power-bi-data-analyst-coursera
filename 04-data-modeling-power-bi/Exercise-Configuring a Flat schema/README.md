# Module 4: Data Modeling in Power BI

## 📌 Exercise: Configuring a Flat Schema

This folder contains the work completed for the **“Configuring a Flat Schema”** exercise from **Module 4** of the Power BI Data Analyst course.  
The exercise focuses on understanding and implementing a **Flat Schema** data model in Power BI.

---

## 🎯 Exercise Objective

The objectives of this exercise are to:

- Load the **AdventureWorksDatasetFlatSchema.xlsx** file into Power BI
- Review and assess the quality of the dataset
- Configure and organize the data as a **Flat Schema**
- Prepare the data model for accurate reporting and analysis

This exercise helps build foundational data-modeling skills before progressing to more advanced schemas such as **Star** and **Snowflake** schemas.

## 📂 Scenario Summary

Adventure Works experienced issues with incorrect and delayed deliveries caused by inconsistencies in their data.

To address this problem, a consolidated dataset was used to create a properly structured **Flat Schema** in Power BI, ensuring reliable and consistent reporting.

## 📌 Notes

A Flat Schema is suitable for smaller datasets and for learning the fundamentals of data modeling.  
For larger and more complex datasets, a **Star Schema** is generally preferred due to better performance and scalability.
