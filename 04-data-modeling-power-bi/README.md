# Module 4: Data Modeling in Power BI

## 📌 Exercise: Configuring a Flat Schema

This folder contains materials and work related to the **“Configuring a Flat Schema”** exercise from Module 4 of the Power BI Data Analyst course. The exercise focuses on understanding and implementing a **Flat Schema** data model in Power BI.

---

## 🎯 Exercise Objective

In this exercise, the goal is to:

* Load the **AdventureWorksDatasetFlatSchema.xlsx** file into Power BI
* Evaluate the quality of the data
* Configure and organize the data as a **Flat Schema**
* Prepare the data model so Adventure Works can use it for accurate reporting and decision-making

This exercise helps build foundational skills in data modeling before moving on to more complex schemas such as star or snowflake schemas.

---

## 📂 Scenario Summary

Adventure Works has experienced issues with incorrect and delayed deliveries due to inconsistencies in their data.

To help resolve this, a properly structured Flat Schema was created in Power BI using a consolidated Excel dataset containing all relevant product and order information.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* Microsoft Excel

## 📌 Notes

A Flat Schema is useful when working with smaller datasets or learning the basics of data modeling. However, for larger and more complex datasets, a Star Schema is usually preferred for better performance and scalability.
